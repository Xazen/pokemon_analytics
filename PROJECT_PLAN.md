# Pokemon Competitive Analytics Project Plan

## Overview
A comprehensive Pokemon competitive team analysis project showcasing modern data engineering and analytics skills. This portfolio project demonstrates the full data pipeline from collection to visualization using industry-standard tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: PySpark for big data processing and ETL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage and warehousing
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, requests, beautifulsoup4, psycopg2, sqlalchemy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: PowerBI dashboard
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub repository

## Data Sources
1. **PokeAPI** - Pokemon base stats, types, abilities, moves, sprites
2. **Pokemon Showdown** - Usage statistics and team compositions (scraping)
3. **Smogon University** - Competitive tiers, strategies, movesets (scraping)
4. **VGC/Tournament data** - Official tournament results (scraping)

## Implementation Phases (Testable Steps)

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable**: Working GitHub repo with Docker PostgreSQL
- [x] Create detailed project plan document
- [x] Initialize git repository and connect to GitHub
- [x] Set up basic project structure and directories
- [x] Create Docker setup for PostgreSQL (test: can connect and query)

**Test**: ✅ Successfully connected to PostgreSQL via Docker and ran basic queries
- 11 tables created across 3 schemas (raw, staging, analytics)
- Docker Compose multi-service setup working
- pgAdmin interface accessible

### Phase 2: Basic Data Collection ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable**: Pokemon data successfully stored in database
- [x] Implement basic PokeAPI data collection script
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL schema and test data insertion
- [x] Create basic data validation and logging

**Test**: ✅ 151 original Pokemon data collected and stored in PostgreSQL
- 151 Pokemon collected with 100% success rate (42.94 seconds)
- 218 type entries, 906 stat entries, 395 ability entries
- Robust error handling and rate limiting implemented
- Data validation and progress logging included

### Phase 3: PySpark Integration ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable**: Working PySpark environment processing Pokemon data
- [x] Add PySpark container and test basic processing
- [x] Implement simple data transformations
- [x] Test PySpark-PostgreSQL connectivity

**Test**: ✅ PySpark successfully reads from and writes to PostgreSQL
- All 4 connectivity tests passed (100% success rate)
- Spark 3.5.0 cluster running (master + worker containers)
- Complex data processing: joins, pivots, aggregations working
- Type analysis results written to staging.type_analysis table
- Stats processing identified strongest Pokemon (Mewtwo: 680 total stats)

### Phase 3.5: Airflow Orchestration ✅ COMPLETED
**Deliverable**: Production-ready workflow orchestration
- [x] Set up Airflow with Docker Compose
- [x] Create Pokemon collection DAG with scheduling
- [x] Implement task dependencies and error handling
- [x] Test workflow execution and monitoring

**Test**: ✅ Scheduled Pokemon data collection DAG running successfully
- Full Airflow stack deployed (4 containers: webserver, scheduler, worker, init)
- Redis message broker for task queuing and distribution
- Production DAG with task groups: preflight checks → data collection → processing
- Enterprise features: resource pooling, retries, comprehensive logging
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC) with proper error handling and validation
- Airflow UI accessible at http://localhost:8081 (admin/admin)

### Phase 4: Web Scraping Implementation 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Deliverable**: Competitive usage data collected
- [ ] Implement web scraping for Pokemon Showdown usage stats
