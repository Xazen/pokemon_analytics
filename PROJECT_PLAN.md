# Pokemon Competitive Analytics Project Plan

## Overview
A comprehensive Pokemon competitive team analysis project showcasing modern data engineering and analytics skills. This portfolio project demonstrates the full data pipeline from collection to visualization using industry-standard tools.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Processing**: PySpark for big data processing and ETL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage and warehousing
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, requests, beautifulsoup4, psycopg2, sqlalchemy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: PowerBI dashboard
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub repository

## Data Sources
1. **PokeAPI** - Pokemon base stats, types, abilities, moves, sprites
2. **Pokemon Showdown** - Usage statistics and team compositions (scraping)
3. **Smogon University** - Competitive tiers, strategies, movesets (scraping)
4. **VGC/Tournament data** - Official tournament results (scraping)
